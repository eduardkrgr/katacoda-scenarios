To use the cobigen cli you first have to install the devonfw ide. You will find more information about devonfw on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/welcome/welcome.html.


If the parent directories aren't already in the project, 'mkdir -p' will create them for you. 

`mkdir -p /root/test/test/test`{{execute T1}}

Switch to the IDE and click 'Copy to Editor'. 

'Test.txt' will be created automatically inside the newly created folder.

<pre class="file" data-filename="test/test/test/Test.txt">

</pre>
