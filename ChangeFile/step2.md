Create a File 


If the parent directories aren't already in the project, 'mkdir -p' will create them for you. 

`mkdir -p /root/devonfw/workspaces/main/some/Folder/For`{{execute T1}}

Switch to the IDE and click 'Copy to Editor'. 

'test.txt' will be created automatically inside the newly created folder.

<pre class="file" data-filename="devonfw/workspaces/main/some/Folder/For/test.txt">
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAA

AAAAAAAAAAAAA
</pre>
