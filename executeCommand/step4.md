In the next steps we want build and run the Angular Frontend Server. For that you need to install the dependencies first.


Please change the folder to &#39;../../angular&#39;.

`cd ../../angular`{{execute T1}}


Install the dependencies from the package.json file.

`devon npm install  `{{execute T1}}


This may take some time.
