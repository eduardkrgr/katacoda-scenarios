Change directory to the directory where we want to execute the command.
 With the next command we also open a new Terminal so you have to execute it twice. 
`cd /root/devonfw/software/node/node_modules/http-server/ `{{execute T2 }} 

Run http-server -p 9090 with this bash-command. 

`http-server -p 9090 `{{execute T2 }}
