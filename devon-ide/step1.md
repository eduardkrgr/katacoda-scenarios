## devonfw-ide setup preparation

We try to make it as simple as possible for you. However, there are some minimal prerequisites:

On Linux you might need to install the above tools in case they are not present
`sudo apt-get install git curl`{{execute}}
in this Case we have them already installes.

First we wanna create a central folder and jump into it.
`mkdir projects`{{execute}}

`cd projects`{{execute}}

Inside this folder, we create a sub-folder for our new project
`mkdir my-project`{{execute}}

`cd my-project`{{execute}}

now we have our folderstructure ready and can start to download the installationfiles
