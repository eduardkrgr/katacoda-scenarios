## devonfw IDE setup preparation

First we wanna create a Folder for the Installation and our Projects

`mkdir projects`{{execute}}

we need a a sub folder for the installation of devonfw-ide so we step into the above created folder

`cd projects`{{execute}}

and create a new Folder here

`mkdir my-project`{{execute}}

`cd my-project`{{execute}}

now we have our folderstructure ready and we need to install git for downloading the devonfw
this can be done on Ubuntu systems with the command 
`sudo apt-get install git curl` (schon installiert) 

Now we have done all preparation
