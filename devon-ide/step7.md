### Uninstall Devon IDE

The devonfw-ide is designed to be non-invasive to your operating system and computer. Therefore it is not "installed" on your system in a classical way. Instead you just create a folder and extract the downloaded archive to it. You only have to install regularly in advance some specific prerequisites like git. All the other softwares remain locally in your devonfw-ide folder. However, there are the following excuses (what is reverted by devon ide uninstall):

so the only thing we have to do is
`devon ide uninstall`{{execute T2}}

and you can remove the Files for removing everything completly 
`rm -f projects`{{execute T2}}
