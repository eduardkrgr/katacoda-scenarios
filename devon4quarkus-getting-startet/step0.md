First we install the dependencies for using quarkus and building our project. Java and Maven will be installed with the DevonfwIDE






Now clone the repository to your local directory.

`git clone https://github.com/devonfw/jump-the-queue.git`{{execute T1}}



Please change the folder to &#39;jump-the-queue/angular&#39;.

`cd jump-the-queue/angular`{{execute T1}}


Install the dependencies from the package.json file.

`npm install  `{{execute T1}}


This may take some time.
